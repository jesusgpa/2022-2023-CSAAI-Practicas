    <p>Esto es un párrafo. Puede ser todo lo extenso que se quiera.
        Aunque en el HTML lo coloquemos en varias
        líneas,
        en el renderizado se coloca en la misma línea
        y se ajusta al ancho de la pantalla
        del navegador
    </p>
    <p>Esto es otro párrafo.
        Se coloca separado del anterior
    </p>
    <p>Este párrafo tiene 3 líneas,
        pero el navegador las coloca juntas
        Otra línea...          y los espacios también
        se eliminan
    </p>

    <p>You act like you want me to be your friend and then you treat me like garbage.</p>
    
    <p>You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. You’re going to take out the demigorgon with a slingshot? It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking. But when you capture the right moment, it says more.</p>

    <p>We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers. It’s about the shadow monster, isn’t it? This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone. She shut one door! With her mind!</p>
    
    <p>You’re going to be home by 8, listening to the Talking Heads and reading Vonnegut or something. That sounds like a nice night. Mouth-breather. Mistakes have been made. It’s finger-lickin’ good. Bitchin' No... no El, you're not the monster. You saved me. Do you understand? You saved me.</p>

    <p>Oh... candy, leftovers, Eggo's... she really likes Eggo's. You act like you want me to be your friend and then you treat me like garbage. Um, I'm happy you're home. If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country. Why do we even need weapons anyway? We have her.</p>

    <p>You’re right. You are a freak…. Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers? So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral. Mistakes have been made. She shut one door! With her mind!</p>
